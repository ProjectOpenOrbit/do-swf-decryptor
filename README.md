# do-swf-decryptor
Suite to decrypt DarkOrbit main.swf and loadingscreen.swf files.

# Purpose
In order to stay up-to-date with the packets of the official gameserver, we need access to the source code of the gameclient.

This is only possible by decrypting the main.swf file containing that information.

Using that information, we can generate source code which implements the official server protocol.
